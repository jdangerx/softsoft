        <h1>Welcome to SoftSoft Software!</h1>

        <p>
            This is <code>softsoft.software</code>, and I am Dazhong Xia. You can hire me to tend software systems for
            you.
            It will cost you $150 an hour.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a decade of experience in professional software development, mostly in full stack web application
            development. I also have done engineering management for a couple of years. I've put more details in my <a
                href="https://www.daz.zone/static/resume.pdf">resume</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have some areas of technical focus:
        <ul>
            <li>
                data processing pipeline automation, management, and maintenance
            </li>
            <li>
                full-stack web application development
            </li>
            <li>
                infrastructure-as-code, continuous integration, and deployment tooling
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>

            If I were a manager looking to hire a contractor to do stuff, I'd be excited by the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                I communicate actively about the status of my work, so you're never guessing at "what's going on over
                there?"
            </li>
            <li>
                I can drive a project to completion, making sure everyone agrees on what we're building, building it,
                and
                resolving issues that come up along the way.
            </li>
            <li>
                I write good documentation and am excited to teach other people about things, so your team won't be left
                in
                the lurch when the contract is over
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
